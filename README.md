# EmployeeManagerSystem
System in which someone can enter in a a new employee with correct fields, which writes in to a MySQL database, or search and existing one, and delete them.

I wrote this program as a lab project in one of my classes. It is meant to simulate something a company would use to add new existing employees to a database,
Look up an existing one, or delete an old one. If you enter the pin number of the person (could be a client as well), it will spit out all of the
information that is stored about that employee.

A lot of my time in this project went towards verification, ensureing that the field entered by the user are compatible with the tables and fields in the DB.

This project was one of the first times I actually dove straight in to inheritance. I had only learned about it conceptually before. I enjoyed making this system,
as it helped me learn a lot and it is something that a company could actually need and use frequently.
